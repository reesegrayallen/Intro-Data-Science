    "No, for a number of reasons. (1) The span of time between Memorial Day and Labor Day is 14 weeks, a little over one fourth of the year; it would make sense that over 25% of burglaries would occur during a period that is approximately 27% of the year. (2) The data in the ad offers no comparison to a different time period, so we cannot make the assumption that burglars are more likely to go to work during the time between Memorial Day and Labor Day. For example, another study might show that 30% of burglars go to work during the month of December; this would mean 30% of burglaries occur in a time period that accounts for about 8.3% of the year, making it far more likely. (3) There could be confounding factors that make burglary more common during this time period or less common during others; or those confounding factors could have affected the statistics and made the percentage seem artifically high. This is an observational study and not a controlled, randomized experiement so we cannot control for those factors. (4) We don't know how many of the people burglarized were actually on vacation. "

    "In lecture, we counted the number of times that the literary characters were named in each chapter of the classic book, [Little Women](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/3/1/literary-characters). In computer science, the word \"character\" also refers to a letter, digit, space, or punctuation mark; any single element of a text. The following code generates a scatter plot in which each dot corresponds to a chapter of Little Women. The horizontal position of a dot measures the number of periods in the chapter. The vertical position measures the total number of characters."
